The input is an array of strings. Each string contains a first_name and last_name separated by a space.
The task is to print the strings in a sorted sequence alphabetically.

Sorting:
- sort by last name
- for common last name sort by first name

Output:
- print first name
- for common first name, print first_name + last_name



# Approach
Use javascript's array.sort method with a custom comparator method which compares last names when unique, and uses first name when common last name. Use a map to identify entries that have common first names; use the map to format and print output.

## Time complexity
array.sort = O(n * log n)
string.split = O(m) where m is length of string
time complexity = O(m * n * log n)

## Space complexity
map to store ambiguity flags = O(n)
