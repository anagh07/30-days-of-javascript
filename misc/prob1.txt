Problem involves:

- Reading a 2 line input:
where the first line is the number of readings/numbers on the second line. The second line is a sequence of numbers separated by space that contains temperature readings that can be both positive and negative.

- Counting the number of negative readings:
from the array/list of numbers we need to count the number of negative (below zero) readings. Print the count to console.



# Approach
Iterate over the array of readings and increase the count when a negative number is identified.

# Steps

## Process Input
- Read stdin using readline for 2 lines. Storing in an array of length 2.
- Parse first line to a number.
- Parse second line to an array of numbers ('temperatures').

## Solution:
- iterate over the 'temperatures' array.
- increase count when temperature is below 0.
- return print count to console.

## Time Complexity
O(n)
We iterate over the input array of length n.

## Space Complexity
O(1)
We only use one additional variable to store the count, which mean constant memory.
